### Problem Statement
This project is based on SFHS CODE HACK’s Subtheme #4 - **Smart Cities Security and Resilient Urban Infrastructure.** <br><br>
Focusing more on the latter - Resilient Urban Infrastructure - with rapid development of "Smart Cities" these days, such as our own "SRINAGAR SMART CITY" in Kashmir, this unprecedented growth rate makes it challenging to easily monitor the exponentially growing number of smart infrastructure projects at a glance.

### Proposed Solution
SmartCity EnergyDashT? is a web-based dashboard designed to provide real-time insights into the city's smart infrastructure. By aggregating data from various IoT devices and systems, the platform offers a centralized view of energy consumption, asset performance, and potential anomalies. Key features include:
- Real-time monitoring: Track energy usage, system status, and performance metrics in real-time.
- Anomaly detection: Identify unusual patterns or deviations from normal behavior to enable proactive maintenance and troubleshooting.
- AI-Enabled Suggestions: Uses state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence to generate suggestions for improvement based on available data.
### Target Audience:
- City administrators and engineers
- Energy managers
- Infrastructure maintenance teams
### Technology Stack:
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JS
- Backend: NodeJS, Amazon Web Services, MongoDB, OpenAI GPT-4o-mini

### Pitch
SmartCity EnergyDash™️ empowers municipalities to monitor their smart infrastructure at a glance, and enables them to pinpoint anomalies and fix them faster. With real-time monitoring and anomaly detection, our platform helps optimize energy consumption, improve asset management, and enhance overall city resilience.
